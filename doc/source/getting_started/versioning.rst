Versioning and Interfaces
*************************
The PyMechanical project attempts to maintain compatibility with legacy
versions of Mechanical while allowing for support of faster and better
interfaces with the latest versions of Mechanical.


Mechanical 2023R1 and Newer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanical v2023R1 and newer support the latest gRPC interface, allowing
for remote management of Mechanical with rapid streaming of mesh, results,
and files from the Mechanical service.  Should you have the applicable
license, you can even install and use Mechanical with docker, enabling you
to run and solve even on officially unsupported platforms like Mac
OS.
